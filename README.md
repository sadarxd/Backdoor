# Backdoor
code is written in oop java.
It uses the execute() function to receive commands from the remote user and execute them on the host machine. 
The function receives a string of command and it's splitting the command by space and based on the number of arguments it creates the ProcessBuilder object and starts the process.
It redirects the error stream and starts the process, reads the output stream and store it in a variable and wait for the process to complete and then closes the input stream.
It returns the output of the command to the remote user.
This code is a Remote Administration Tool (RAT) that creates a socket connection to a specified IP address and port, and allows the client to execute commands on the server machine. 
The code reads the commands from the client, splits them by spaces, and then creates a new ProcessBuilder object with the command and arguments. The ProcessBuilder object is used to execute the command on the server machine and redirects the error stream to the input stream, so that the output of the command can be captured. 
The output is then read by a BufferedReader and saved to a variable. 
The command output is returned to the client and the BufferedReader and the process are closed.

This code is similar to the one you provided earlier, but with some modifications to support multiple arguments for the command and also the output is returned back to the client.

It is important to note that, like the previous code you provided, this code does not have any security features and does not encrypt the communication between the client and the server, which could be intercepted by a third party.
